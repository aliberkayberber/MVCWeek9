When the application is opened, it starts from the home page. If you go to the author and book pages without registering, you cannot do anything on it. You need to register to be able to do something with the data in the list. When you go to the registration page (Sign up) and enter the information, if you do not enter the appropriate data, the page will open again. If you click the Sign up button after entering the correct data, you will be directed directly to the Sign in page. If you enter the data registered on the page, you will have successfully logged in. After logging in, you can add, edit and delete authors and books. You can exit with the Sign out button. The application has been tested manually.
